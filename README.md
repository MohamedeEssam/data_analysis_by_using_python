# üìä Welcome to Data Analysis with Python Training

## üßæ Training Description

This training provides an overview of the different phases of the **data analysis pipeline using Python** and its rich ecosystem of libraries.

We assume that data is already available and ready for download. After downloading, the data needs to be cleaned to enable effective analysis. During the **cleaning phase**, the data is converted into a uniform and consistent format to prepare it for analysis.

The goal is to **manipulate data into forms that help us discover relationships, trends, and patterns**.

We‚Äôll also explore **data visualization** as a tool for better insight and understanding, and introduce **machine learning** as a method to build models for prediction and explanation.

**Python** is widely used in data analysis due to its simplicity and the availability of high-performance libraries such as `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `SciPy`, and `Scikit-learn` ‚Äî all of which will be covered in this training.

No prior Python experience is required, but good programming skills in another language are expected. A solid understanding of **linear algebra** and **probability calculus** is also required.
